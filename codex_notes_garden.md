Task summary:
Push current local work on `main` to GitHub under `shimmer-hue/Adam`.
Scope of work:
Verify remote/auth state, record the operation, commit any required log changes, and push local commits to `origin/main`.
Likely files/modules:
`/Users/brianray/Adam/codex_notes_garden.md`, Git metadata, and remote `origin`.
Relevant invariants:
Stay on `main`, do not rewrite history, use append-only notes, and preserve current MLX/TUI repo constraints without runtime changes.
Proof path (how success will be verified):
Confirm local branch status, inspect commits ahead of `origin/main`, run push, and verify `main` matches `origin/main`.
## [2026-03-07 09:47:24 EST] POST-FLIGHT
Files changed:
`/Users/brianray/Adam/.gitignore` and `/Users/brianray/Adam/codex_notes_garden.md`.
Behavior implemented or modified:
Rebuilt the unpushed local `main` history without oversized generated `graph_knowledge_base` export blobs, added ignore rules for future oversized export HTML/JSON files, and pushed `main` to `origin`.
Evidence (tests / commands run):
`git push --dry-run origin main`, `git push origin main`, and `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...main` returned `0 0`.
Docs updated:
No feature docs changed; operational log appended and `.gitignore` updated to prevent future GitHub push failures.
Remaining uncertainties or follow-ups:
Older export artifacts remain tracked on `origin/main`; only the newly blocked oversized files were removed from the unpushed history.

Task summary:
Merge branch-held progress into `main` without losing work or reintroducing blocked oversized artifacts.
Scope of work:
Audit `codex/*` branches for unique commits, back up current `main`, merge or absorb branch-only work into `main`, run verification, and push the result to GitHub.
Likely files/modules:
Git branch history, `/Users/brianray/Adam/codex_notes_garden.md`, and any source/docs touched by branch-only commits.
Relevant invariants:
Do not rewrite or drop user progress, avoid restoring GitHub-rejected export blobs, keep append-only notes, and verify with repo-local tooling.
Proof path (how success will be verified):
Inspect branch diffs/cherries, merge or cherry-pick required work onto `main`, run `./.venv/bin/pytest -q`, and confirm `main` equals `origin/main` after push.
