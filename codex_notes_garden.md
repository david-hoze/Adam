## [2026-03-07 09:44:09 EST] PRE-FLIGHT
Task summary:
Push current local work on `main` to GitHub under `shimmer-hue/Adam`.
Scope of work:
Verify remote/auth state, record the operation, commit any required log changes, and push local commits to `origin/main`.
Likely files/modules:
`/Users/brianray/Adam/codex_notes_garden.md`, Git metadata, and remote `origin`.
Relevant invariants:
Stay on `main`, do not rewrite history, use append-only notes, and preserve current MLX/TUI repo constraints without runtime changes.
Proof path (how success will be verified):
Confirm local branch status, inspect commits ahead of `origin/main`, run push, and verify `main` matches `origin/main`.
## [2026-03-07 09:47:24 EST] POST-FLIGHT
Files changed:
`/Users/brianray/Adam/.gitignore` and `/Users/brianray/Adam/codex_notes_garden.md`.
Behavior implemented or modified:
Rebuilt the unpushed local `main` history without oversized generated `graph_knowledge_base` export blobs, added ignore rules for future oversized export HTML/JSON files, and pushed `main` to `origin`.
Evidence (tests / commands run):
`git push --dry-run origin main`, `git push origin main`, and `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...main` returned `0 0`.
Docs updated:
No feature docs changed; operational log appended and `.gitignore` updated to prevent future GitHub push failures.
Remaining uncertainties or follow-ups:
Older export artifacts remain tracked on `origin/main`; only the newly blocked oversized files were removed from the unpushed history.
## [2026-03-07 09:51:43 EST] PRE-FLIGHT
Task summary:
Merge branch-held progress into `main` without losing work or reintroducing blocked oversized artifacts.
Scope of work:
Audit `codex/*` branches for unique commits, back up current `main`, merge or absorb branch-only work into `main`, run verification, and push the result to GitHub.
Likely files/modules:
Git branch history, `/Users/brianray/Adam/codex_notes_garden.md`, and any source/docs touched by branch-only commits.
Relevant invariants:
Do not rewrite or drop user progress, avoid restoring GitHub-rejected export blobs, keep append-only notes, and verify with repo-local tooling.
Proof path (how success will be verified):
Inspect branch diffs/cherries, merge or cherry-pick required work onto `main`, run `./.venv/bin/pytest -q`, and confirm `main` equals `origin/main` after push.
## [2026-03-07 09:54:19 EST] POST-FLIGHT
Files changed:
`/Users/brianray/Adam/codex_notes_garden.md`.
Behavior implemented or modified:
Backed up the pre-consolidation `main` tip, audited all `codex/*` branches, and merged remaining non-ancestor branch histories into `main` with safe `ours` merges where their meaningful code was already represented on `main` or where the branch only preserved stale artifact history.
Evidence (tests / commands run):
`git branch --merged main`, `git log --graph -10`, and `./.venv/bin/pytest -q` with `31 passed in 6.46s`.
Docs updated:
Operational log appended; product docs unchanged because repository contents stayed on the current `main` tree.
Remaining uncertainties or follow-ups:
Branch refs still exist after consolidation; delete them only if you want branch cleanup in addition to merge history.
## [2026-03-07 09:58:36 EST] POST-FLIGHT
Files changed:
`/Users/brianray/Adam/codex_notes_garden.md`.
Behavior implemented or modified:
Rebuilt branch consolidation from `origin/main` after GitHub rejected local merge ancestry containing oversized export and `.venv` blobs; kept `main` pushable, merged the safe `codex/2-oneshot-reboot` branch into `main`, and repointed local backup branches to clean commits already represented on `main`.
Evidence (tests / commands run):
`git rev-list --objects origin/main..main | git cat-file --batch-check ... | tail -20`, `./.venv/bin/pytest -q` with `31 passed in 6.33s`, and branch ancestry checks against `main`.
Docs updated:
Operational log appended; product docs unchanged.
Remaining uncertainties or follow-ups:
The local helper branch `codex/main-failed-consolidation-attempt-20260307` preserves the rejected merge attempt for inspection; it is not needed for runtime behavior and can be cleaned up later.
## [2026-03-07 09:59:59 EST] PRE-FLIGHT
Task summary:
Delete every branch except `main` and ensure future commits use the `shimmer-hue` git identity.
Scope of work:
Audit local and remote refs, remove the non-`main` worktree, delete non-`main` local and remote branches, set local git identity, and verify only `main` remains.
Likely files/modules:
Git refs, worktree metadata, and `/Users/brianray/Adam/codex_notes_garden.md`.
Relevant invariants:
Stay on `main`, do not disturb current tracked files, remove only non-`main` refs/worktrees, and keep commit identity explicitly configured for this repo.
Proof path (how success will be verified):
Confirm branch/worktree inventory before and after deletion, verify `git config user.name`/`user.email`, and ensure `git branch -a` shows only `main` plus `origin/main`.
## [2026-03-07 10:00:30 EST] POST-FLIGHT
Files changed:
`/Users/brianray/Adam/codex_notes_garden.md`.
Behavior implemented or modified:
Removed all non-`main` local branches, removed the extra non-`main` worktree, deleted the non-`main` remote branch, and explicitly set the repo-local git identity to `user.name=shimmer-hue` and `user.email=warnerpallitz@gmail.com`.
Evidence (tests / commands run):
`git branch -a -vv`, `git worktree list`, `git config --get user.name`, `git config --get user.email`, and `git status --short --branch`.
Docs updated:
Operational log appended; repository code/docs unchanged.
Remaining uncertainties or follow-ups:
GitHub commit attribution depends on the email remaining associated with the `shimmer-hue` account; the repo-local git config is now pinned for future commits in this repo.
